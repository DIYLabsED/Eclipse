# EclipseDrivers

## Contains all of Eclipse's core drivers and one manager to rule them all!

This file structure might seem weird at first, but that's ok. To use, move the EclipseDrivers
folder to your Arduino/libraries folder. If you get compilation errors about not finding certain 
stuff, try moving all the drivers in the drivers subfolder outside that subfolder, into the
EclipseDrivers folder.
