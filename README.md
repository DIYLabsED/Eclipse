# Eclipse
## An open-source code platform for making self-driving hobby vehicles


(Note: Eclipse refers to both the software, and the vehicle with which I tested it on)

This software is meant to be used for making self-driving car software easier to make. Youc an use this software instead of writing your own. Eclipse's 
software is flexible, much lke Marlin, an open-source software for 3d printers. The software's core components are generalized, and for low-level IO, there are drivers. To make your own vehicle run on Eclipse, all you need to do is modify the configuration files, and maybe tweak the drivers for your specific vehicle.

This software was written by Adbhut Patil. Check out my YouTube channel for videos on Eclipse, and other projects:
